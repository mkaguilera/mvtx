MVTX: Modular Multi-Version Transactional Key-Value Storage System v0.1

MVTX is a distributed key-value storage system with the following features:
- it provides serializable transactions
- it is highly modular, permitting experimentation with different
  components for local storage, transactional protocol, logging, RPC, etc

MVTX is a prototype currently designed for educational purposes only.
Currently it lacks replication, but we hope to add it at some point.

Please see readme-team.txt for description of files, intended for
developers.
