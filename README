LegoStore: Modular Multi-Version Transactional Key-Value Storage System v0.1

LegoStore is a modular distributed key-value storage system. In particular, LegoStore permits experimentation with
different implementations for storage, transactional protocols, communication protocols, etc. Modularity is benefitial
for two main reasons.
- Key-value storage systems that have a lot of similarities can share common infrastructure. For example, if two
key-value storage systems implemented in top of LegoStore require the same consistency level, both can share the same
concurrency control protocol implementation.
- LegoStore provides a common platform for efficiently comparing different implementations. In particular, developers
might modify a specific module (e.g. storage module) and observe the difference in performance without touching any of
the other modules (minimum changes required).

Developers can read a more detailed explanation of supported modules in the src directory. This README is oriented to
explain installation and usage of LegoStore.
